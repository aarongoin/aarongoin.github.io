	It’s not truly finished. There are performance optimizations to be had in tuning the code a little more precisely. And there would be a massive speed boost from using WebGL to draw all the sprites. WebGL has roughly 60-90% support worldwide, so perhaps if I find the time and inclination: I’ll implement that change.
