	Weave started out as a <a href="" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> project. Before I worked on this, I had never used Vue.js before, and indeed this app was partly an effort to teach myself just what Vue could do. And for a while that was really great. Vue is a nicely polished framework. But I felt hampered by it half-way through. And about that time I discovered <a href="" target="_blank">Preact</a>, which is a tiny open-source React clone. Preact touts itself as a drop-in replacement for React, but comes without Facebook's license, is less than 1/14th the size.
