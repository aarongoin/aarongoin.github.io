	I took a Web Data class this past semester, and teamed up with another classmate to produce Sweetnums as an assignment for that class. Sweetnums is a searchable database of Candies, Fruits, and Baked Confections scraped from Wikipedia. Scroll endlessly through pictures of results, and click on any result to see a larger image, with text detail, and Nutritional Facts pulled from the USDA nutritional facts database.
